### History

Pavel lived most of his life in the Tsardom of Austrasea, on the world of Oerth. He was a peasant hunter and trapper, living humbly on what he caught, a solitary life with no intention of settling down or building a family. On his 24th birthday, while out in the nearby woods owned by the local lord, he was captured and tried for the crime of poaching. Upon his conviction, he was given the choice of death by hanging, or 10 years' service in the Expeditionary Army (widely considered to be the worse decision of the two).

Stupidly, he chose service over death, and was immediately sent to the far East reaches of the empire, where it was said new and mysterious lands lay waiting to be annexed by the Tsar's armies. Cast into this strange country with little training, Pavel was joined the ranks of the vanguard as they spread across the continent, encountering all manner of new sights -- golden temples on mountaintops, vast cities of pure marble -- as well as unfamiliar enemies. They held back hordes of centaur archers on the Eastern Steppe, and conquered the lands all the way to the Eastern Sea, before turning South.

The fate of the regiment turned South then as well, and they suffered terrible losses to the Southern Kingdoms of the elves, and their armies of war elephants and disc-throwing sycophants. The regiment broke in retreat, and was scattered across the jungle lands. Pavel found himself lost and alone, and wandered for days through the heat and insects, until he came to a great swamp with a single island and a massive gnarled tree at its center.

With no way around, he had no choice but to cross the swamp, hoping to find an exit to the jungle beyond. Halfway to the island, he was set upon by an enormous horned crocodile -- Sebek, The Smiling Death. Its maw opened and moved to swallow him whole, and Pavel, resigned to his certain death, made one final joke, mocking the creature's foul breath. Amused, Sebek decided to strike a bargain with him. "Bring me one thousand souls, and you shall keep yours." the creature said, and Pavel agreed without hesitation. "Only one thing," Sebek growled as it slipped back below the murky water. "I think I desire the taste of something more...foreign."

The great tree at the center of the swamp groaned, and its roots shot out like tentacles and grabbed Pavel up into the air. Lighting coursed through the limbs of the tree and into his body, and his vision faded to the sound of wicked, gurgling laughter. When Pavel awoke he found himself in a foreign land, the continent of Faer√ªn, on the planet Toril.
