### History

Sebek was the son of an ancient manifestation of the Mulhorandi god Set and a bestial archfey of the Feywild known as Mornach.Prior to the Time of Troubles, the largest sect of Sebek's worshipers were expelled from Mulhorand by the Brotherhood of Those Who Smile in the Face of Death. They resettled in Chessenta.

In the late years of the 15th century DR, some rumors said that Sebek was living in the Adder Swamp.

### Church of Sebek

All clergy of the church of Sebek were werecrocodiles, usually of Mulan descent.

Priests of Sebek spend much of their time planning methods of seizing power in their surrounding regions.

The city of Sekras housed a temple that served as the center of the church of Sebek, known as the River's Maw. Upon the city's destruction, the clergy relocated to the Adder Swamp of Chessenta. No temples dedicated to the "Smiling Death" were known to exist as of 1358 DR.

#### Worshipers

Worship of Sebek was rare, and even considered anathema in some places, such as Chessenta, though he was often well respected in communities near large populations of crocodiles.

Priests of Sebek wore linen skirts and collars, and shaved their heads. They favored no ornamentation in crocodile form. When preparing for combat, the clergy of Sebek favored light armor and simple weapons.

Clerics of Sebek prayed for spells at dusk.

#### Affiliated orders

All werecrocodiles followed Sebek, though no organizations were known to be sponsored by the church.

#### Celebrations and festivals

Monthly offerings of meat were dedicated to Sebek in order to ward off crocodile attacks.

Priests of Sebek had to kill a sentient creature monthly, as well as create at least one new werecrocodile from among the humans living in Mulhorand each year.
