### Mosaic Puzzle

Floor tiles with idyllic scene. Corpses suggest trap. Poem painted on the wall in gold:

> Dawn breaks with stirring air,
> As sun shines down on new day fair.
>
> Midday blaze bakes earth and grass,
> The farmer waits for heat to pass.
>
> Evening cool brings water, wine,
> Drink and laughter passing time.
>
> Night sees shining, roaring fire,
> as wood and coals burn on the pyre.

Solved by stepping only on the images mentioned: _sun_, _grass_, _water_, _fire_.

### Giant Fire Spider

Massive flaming spider attacked and pins Melmond. They defeat it with a sick combo of Hex and Thunderwave. Turns out the animals were drinking leftover wizard potions and getting all roided out.
