### Orc Ambush

We spot 3 orcs minding their own business. Zephyer thinks a sneak attack is the move. Pavel disagrees, but the fight ensues. Melmond commands one to jump into the river and die. The second is vaporized by Pavel's eldritch blast. Presdove nails the last with a marksman's shot from 105ft. Pavel feels bad about their decision, but they have a heart-to-heart.

### Rivercrest

We enter the small town of [Rivercrest](%base_url%/places/rivercrest). There are some scorched buildings. Trevor meets us and brings us to [Lyle Proudbarrel](%base_url%/people/lyle-proudbarrel), a gnome not unlike Gorth in temperament. He takes us through the beautiful manor grounds, grape fields, to his house. He has a grand presentation on his problem, which we fuck up. This time, one survivor made it out. 9-year-old Rurick says they were people-sized, but looked like goblins. We renegotiate the deal for 150GP per barrel and 100GP per person recovered.

We go to visit Rurick, who is freaked the fuck out cuz his mom was taken. Gorth rudely hurries him into telling that they were ambushed and brutally attacked
