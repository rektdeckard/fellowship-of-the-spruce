### Orc Ambush

The party spots 3 orcs minding their own business. [Zephyer](%base_url%/players/zephyer-vokasys) thinks a sneak attack is the move. [Pavel](%base_url%/players/pavel-kilkaelan) disagrees, but the fight ensues. [Melmond](%base_url%/players/melmond-thurgus) commands one to jump into the river and die. The second is vaporized by [Pavel](%base_url%/players/pavel-kilkaelan)'s eldritch blast. [Presdove](%base_url%/players/presdove-firhael) nails the last with a marksman's shot from 105ft. [Pavel](%base_url%/players/pavel-kilkaelan) feels bad about their decision, but they have a heart-to-heart.

### Rivercrest

We enter the small town of [Rivercrest](%base_url%/places/rivercrest). There are some scorched buildings. Trevor meets the gang and brings us to [Lyle Proudbarrel](%base_url%/people/lyle-proudbarrel), a gnome not unlike Gorth in temperament. He takes the party through the beautiful manor grounds, grape fields, to his house. He has a grand presentation on his problem, which is rudely interrupted. This time, one survivor made it out. 9-year-old Rurick says they were people-sized, but looked like goblins. We renegotiate the deal for 150GP per barrel and 100GP per person recovered.

We go to visit Rurick, who is freaked the fuck out because his mom was taken. [Gorth](%base_url%/players/gorth-clamly) rudely hurries him into telling that they were ambushed and brutally attacked.
