### Spooky Books

[Melmond](%base_url%/players/melmond-thurgus) is raised from unconsciousness by a song from Gorth's lute. He then investivates the statue, and inside finds a leather-bound book covered in runes. It sears his hand when he touches it. [Gorth](%base_url%/players/gorth-clamly) reads the title as: `The Book of Dark Obedience`. [Pavel](%base_url%/players/pavel) seeks the advice of his patron [Sebek](%base_url%/lore/gods/sebek) on what the book might be for. It seems there is no good it can do on this plane, even in good hands. Without discussion, Pavel agrees to turn it over to him â€“ his buddy has been looking for centuries. A portal opens at their feet and Pavel quickly kicks the book in, to his comrades' great surprise.

On the way back through the tunnels, Pavel falls in the drink. [Presdove](%base_url%/players/presdove-firhael) comes after him, and Melmond hauls them up one at a time. They finally go to recover the wine barrels, and Melmond gets sloppy drinking the dirty leftovers of the half-empty one. 

### Doing the Worm

After returning to [Rivercrest](%base_url%/places/rivercrest), [Lyle](%base_url%/people/lyle-proudbarrel) thanks us profusely for returning his wine. Less psyched about the people. Nokkerg and [Rhozeg](%base_url%/people/rhozeg) are taken to the stockade. The gang minus [Zephyer](%base_url%/players/zephyer-vokasys) decide to break their hobgoblin friends out and give them a second chance. After unnecessary planning, Gorth simply persuades the guard to release them into our custody. Then Melmond makes him do the worm for no reason. We put a few gold in the hobgoblins' pockets and tell them to have a nice life.

Back in [Mirabar](%base_url%/places/mirabar), we go SHOPPING.
