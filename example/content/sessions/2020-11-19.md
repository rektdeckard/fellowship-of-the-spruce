### Dungeons and Draugrs

Green runic letters appear carved in the wall, lighting up the entire cave. Melmond seems to recognize the text vaguely. Gorth casts Comprehen languages:

> The unworthy wish for death, but never find it.

All the hobs start freaking out and attempt to flee. We kill two, and Nokkerg leaves the cave to be captured by our guards outside. We release the hostages and enter the central passage, where the glyphs now read:

> Prepare yourself. You are entering the home of the Brimstone Baron.

Deep in the right path, we find a secret chamber where Amber was held separately. She put up a good fight and the hobs kept her separate. She wants to join us to fight the dark magic, but is too hurt to be of use and Gorth convinces her to wait outside.

Down the right passage is a deep ravine into a river. Zephyer jumps it and is splatted against the wall by a gian spider!

Fight some undead

Draugr in front of massive demon statue. Melmond goes into a divine trance and charges. The team wails on him until Presdove fires the killing blow through his ear.
