### Dungeons and Draugrs

Green runic letters appear carved in the wall of [Tyrkaven Cave](%base_url%/places/tyrkaven-cave), lighting up the entire place. [Melmond](%base_url%/players/melmond-thurgus) seems to recognize the text vaguely. [Gorth](%base_url%/players/gorth-clamly) casts Comprehend languages:

> The unworthy wish for death, but never find it.

All the hobs start freaking out and attempt to flee. We kill two, and Nokkerg leaves the cave to be captured by our guards outside. We release the hostages and enter the central passage, where the glyphs now read:

> Prepare yourself. You are entering the home of the Brimstone Baron.

Deep in the right path, we find a secret chamber where Amber was held separately. She put up a good fight and the hobs kept her separate. She wants to join us to fight the dark magic, but is too hurt to be of use and Gorth convinces her to wait outside.

Down the right passage is a deep ravine into a river. [Zephyer](%base_url%/players/zephyer-vokasys) jumps it and is splatted against the wall by a giant spider! We pull some sick moves and turn it into jelly. [Melmond](%base_url%/players/melmond-thurgus) spies some gold pieces on a ledge below the precipice, and nearly falls trying to grab them. After almost making the same mistake twice, he climbs back up. [Pavel](%base_url%/players/pavel-kilkaelan) and [Presdove](%base_url%/players/presdove-firhael) secure a rope across the gap, and the rest army-crawl across.

We fight our way through some undead in the passageways, until we reach a giant vaulted room with ruined statues. A Draugr appears in front of a massive demon statue. [Melmond](%base_url%/players/melmond-thurgus) goes into a divine trance and charges. [Melmond](%base_url%/players/melmond-thurgus) goes into a divine trance and charges. He takes some serious hits and goes down. The team wails on the Draugr until [Presdove](%base_url%/players/presdove-firhael) fires the killing blow through his ear.
