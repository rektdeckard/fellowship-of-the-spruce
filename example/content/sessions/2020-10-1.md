### Hobjob at the Inn

We go to the last meeting place set with [Calidor's](%base_url%/people/calidor) party, the inn at [Havel's cross](%base_url%/places/havel's-cross). Forified building filled with a band of goblins and the corpses of several humans, dwarves, and gnomes. We surprise them with bear traps and kill a few before they call a truce. They saw [Calidor](%base_url%/people/calidor) and tracked their party to this place. But when they returned to raid, they found everyone in the inn dead. No sign of the elf. We force them to tip [Gorth](%base_url%/players/gorth-clamly) for his music, and tell them to clear off.

Inside, the bodies 

Ghouls??
