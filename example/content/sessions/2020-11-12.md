### Ambush at the Cavern

Shortly outside of town, a band of hobgoblins ambushes the party. Our four commoner companions run to safety and we obliterate all but one of the combatants. The last one, [Rhozeg](%base_url%/people/rhozeg) spills the beans on his comrades, the Lieutenant Deathbringer and the 5 or 6 others who guard the wine and hostages at Tyrkaven Cave.

VERY unstealthily siege the cave, and kill a few Hobs. [Rhozeg](%base_url%/people/rhozeg) is hit by his comrade's arrows and Pavel comes to his aid with a potion. Zephyer and Gorth run to the western room and find the hostages and a possibly friendly chef hobgoblin, Nokkerg, who they get to throw down his weapon. In the east wind, the others find more enemies, including an acolyte wielding magic. [Rhozeg](%base_url%/people/rhozeg) flees out of the cavern. Pavel aims an Eldritch Blast at him and misses wildly, hitting the wall...
