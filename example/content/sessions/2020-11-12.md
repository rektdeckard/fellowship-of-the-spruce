Shortly outside of town, a band of hobgoblins ambushes the party. Our four commoner companions run to safety and we obliterate all but one of the combatants. The last one, [Rhozeg](%base_url%/people/rhozeg) spills the beans on his comrades, the Lieutenant Deathbringer and the 5 or 6 others who guard the wine and hostages at [Tyrkaven Cave](%base_url%/places/tyrkaven-cave).

We VERY unstealthily siege the cave, and kill a few Hobs. [Rhozeg](%base_url%/people/rhozeg) is hit by his comrade's arrows and [Pavel](%base_url%/players/pavel-kilkaelan) comes to his aid with a potion. [Zephyer](%base_url%/players/zephyer-vokasys) and [Gorth](%base_url%/players/gorth-clamly) run to the western room and find the hostages and a possibly friendly chef hobgoblin, Nokkerg, who they get to throw down his weapon. In the east wing, the others find more enemies, including an acolyte wielding magic. [Rhozeg](%base_url%/people/rhozeg) flees out of the cavern. [Pavel](%base_url%/players/pavel-kilkaelan) aims an Eldritch Blast at him and misses wildly, hitting the wall...
