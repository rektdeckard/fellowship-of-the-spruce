### Meet Zephyr and Winsome at NAME????? Tavern

Party agrees to try their luck adventuring together, but [Presdove](%base_url%/players/presdove-firhael) needs some convincing. Head to [Mirabar](%base_url%/places/mirabar) to find work, and end up at a halfling tavern. Gorth recognizes an "old fling" at a table, approaches with drinks.

[Winsome](%base_url%/people/winsome), archaeological student, sent team of adventurers ([Calidor](%base_url%/people/calidor) the elf, Shatterbone the dwarf) to [Lurkwood](%base_url%/places/lurkwood) to find [Elven death temple](%base_url%/places/elven-death-temple). Reported that they found something interesting, then disappeared. She engages party to help find them, and any artifacts relating to cult. Offers 110 GP each. Agree, and take a coach to edge of forest and continue on foot.

### Dire Wolves

Not far in, [Zephyer](%base_url%/players/zephyer-vokasys) senses they are being followed, and discreetly investigates. Finds a pack of wolves and a dire wolf. Sneak-attacks, and the party jumps in to help. [Melmond](%base_url%/players/melmond-thurgus) surrounded and holds his own, cleaving several wolves. [Gorth](%base_url%/players/gorth-clamly) takes a ton of damage and drops his rapier. [Pavel](%base_url%/players/pavel-kilkaelan) vaporizes the dire wolf. [Zephyer](%base_url%/players/zephyer-vokasys) lands the final killing blow with an arrow.

### Getting to Know You

Spend first night around a campfire. [Zephyer](%base_url%/players/zephyer-vokasys) is tight-lipped about her past, [Pavel](%base_url%/players/pavel-kilkaelan) makes a gesture by sharing his flask. [Presdove](%base_url%/players/presdove-firhael) tells his story, losing his mother and sister...to what? Something doesn't check out.

### Satyr Jam Sesh

Next day party continues toward [Havel's Cross](%base_url%/places/havel's-cross), closest settlement to the temple. Find weird goat tracks and follow them to find group of satyrs playing music. [Melmond](%base_url%/players/melmond-thurgus) tests the water by joining in on his pipe, and it turns into full-on jam sesh.

Satyrs say saw [Calidor](%base_url%/people/calidor) and the other adventurers, and that the temple is probably in the marshland 7 miles north of [Havel's Cross](%base_url%/places/havel's-cross), and to be careful.
