## Background

Lyle runs a vineyard in the town of [Rivercrest](%base_url%/places/rivercrest), east of [Mirabar](%base_url%/places/mirabar) in the foothills of the Sword Mountains. Recently, his caravan had come under attack from local bandits, and his shipment, along with a number of townspeople, were lost to the thieves. He sent word through his associate Bridget Irrgsen, that he would pay 50GP per barrel and 100GP for the recovery of his property and employees.
